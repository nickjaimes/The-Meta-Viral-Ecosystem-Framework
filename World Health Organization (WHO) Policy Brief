World Health Organization (WHO) Policy Brief

The Meta-Viral Ecosystem Framework (MVEF)

An Adaptive Intelligence Infrastructure for Global Health Security and Preparedness

Institutional Context

World Health Organization leads global efforts in surveillance, preparedness, response, and normative guidance. Health threats increasingly interact with supply chains, finance, misinformation, and climate systems.

Problem Statement

While surveillance capacity has improved, adaptive response and cross-sector integration lag behind the speed of emerging health threats. Lessons from past outbreaks are not always operationalized in time.

Framework Relevance

MVEF enhances WHO’s mission by functioning as a global health learning and adaptation layer:
   •   Continuous evaluation of intervention effectiveness
   •   Rapid recombination of insights across health, logistics, finance, and communication
   •   Preservation of failure and success knowledge beyond individual emergencies

Operational Alignment
   •   Health-Specific Adaptive Systems: Surveillance, diagnostics, treatment protocols, and delivery mechanisms evolve under real-world feedback.
   •   Cross-Sector Recombination: Health intelligence integrates with supply-chain logistics, digital infrastructure, and behavioral science.
   •   Meta-Optimization: Balances rapid innovation with safety, equity, and ethical constraints.
   •   Human Governance: WHO normative authority, ethics, and International Health Regulations remain central.

Strategic Value
   •   Earlier outbreak containment
   •   Faster translation of research into practice
   •   Reduced repetition of response failures
   •   Stronger preparedness across diverse health systems
